# Snake (pygame)

Minimal Snake game built with `pygame`.

## Install
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
```bash
python snake.py
```

## Controls
- Arrow keys: move
- P: pause/unpause
- R: restart (from game over screen)
- ESC or close window: quit

## Notes
- If you're on a headless machine (no display), `pygame` won't open a window.
- Window size and speed can be tweaked in the constants at the top of `snake.py`.
